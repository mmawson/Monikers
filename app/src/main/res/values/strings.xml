    <string name="gameDescription" translatable="false">Monikers is a party game based on public domain game Celebrity.
        Two teams, comprised of two or more players each, come together for a minimum of
        four players. To start the game, any player can use their mobile phone and enter five monikers,
        which can be anyone or anything - real or fictitious.\n
        The game takes place over 3 rounds. In the first round, players may use any words they like as clues for their partners to guess.\n
        In the second round, players may only use 1 word as a clue.\n
        In the third round, players may only use gestures to communicate with their team.\n
        The team with the most points after 3 rounds wins.</string>
